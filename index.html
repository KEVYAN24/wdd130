      <p>Quito, the capital of Ecuador, is a city nestled in the Andes at an altitude of approximately 2,850 meters above sea level. With a mild climate year-round, Quito is renowned for its historic center, a UNESCO World Heritage site, featuring colonial churches and cobblestone plazas that reflect its rich history. It is also a cultural and political hub in the country, and its proximity to the equator gives it the nickname "The Middle of the World." Surrounded by majestic volcanoes, Quito blends tradition and innovation in a unique landscape.</p>
